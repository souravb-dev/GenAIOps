## Sub-tasks / Checklist:
- [x] Create root project directory structure (frontend/, backend/, deployment/, docs/)
- [x] Initialize React application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Setup FastAPI project structure with virtual environment
- [x] Install and configure development dependencies (ESLint, Prettier, pytest)
- [x] Create .gitignore file with appropriate exclusions
- [x] Setup package.json and requirements.txt files
- [x] Initialize Git repository and create initial commit
- [x] Create basic docker-compose.yml for local development

## PRD Reference:
* Section: "Frontend Stack" and "Backend Stack"
* Key Requirements:
    * React + Tailwind CSS + Axios for frontend
    * Python (FastAPI) or Node.js for backend
    * All components containerized using Docker
    * Deploy on OCI OKE using Helm charts

## Notes:
